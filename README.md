# Reverse Engineering YxYY
In the spirit of our community of sharing, I though it would worthwhile to open source the code behind YxYY, but it seems that nobody knows where the original code is (apparently, it's a daemon on some hidden subsystem; no associated GitHub repos, etc). So, I thought perhaps we could reverse engineer it. Here's my start with javascript (hey, it's the language of the Web, people!). Also, please note that there are few references to other libraries that may rely on unknown remote APIs (e.g. magicVoodooAwesomesauce.js, mojoEntrancinator.js). I'm sure you guys will have ideas for how to improve on this very, very basic start.

Thanks again, all of you, for making my life immeasurably richer.
